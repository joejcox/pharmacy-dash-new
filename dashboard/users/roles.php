// This page will show the roles that exist, a button to create a role, buttons to edit each of the roles.

// Need to print out the role names with PHP and then echo the buttons to create role and edit role (this will open a modal with a form that will allow them to change role name and permissions, modal form action will be _edit-role.php)
